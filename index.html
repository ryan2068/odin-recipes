        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>These copycat McDonalds Chicken Nuggets are so similar to those at their restaurants that you would think its the real thing. They are delicious and the perfect hunger-buster!</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 chicken fillets, boneless, skin removed and diced</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups corn starch, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken in a food processor with the salt and one egg. Blend until it forms a paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl or container, place the corn starch. Using wet hands, take a handful of blended chicken and shape into a nugget. Cover the nugget with corn starch, shake off the excess and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Finish shaping and coating the nuggets before moving on to the next step.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the water, one egg, mustard, garlic and onion powder, ground pepper and all-purpose flour. You should have a thick but runny batter. Place one nugget at a time in the batter and place it back onto the lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>lace the tray in the freezer and allow them to freeze for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat your oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Deep fry the first batch for 5 minutes. Allow the chicken nuggets to drain on paper towel for 3-4 minutes. Deep fry the same batch again for 5 minutes. This ensures that the chicken cooks all the way through without getting too dark.</li>
            <li>Serve these nuggets warm with any dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
